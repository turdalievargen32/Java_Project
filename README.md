# Farm Simulation Project

## Description
The Farm Simulation project is a visualization of a farm where farmers plant crops, pests try to destroy them, and defenders fight pests. It is an interactive model that allows you to observe the dynamic interactions between different entities on a farm.

## Technologies
The project is written in Java using Swing for the GUI.

## Functionality
- **Farmers**: Plant crops in random places.
- **Pests**: Attack crops in random places if there are no defenders there.
- **Defenders**: Destroy pests in neighboring cells.

## Installation and launch
To run the project, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher installed.
