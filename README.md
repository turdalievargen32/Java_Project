## Introduction

This Java project is a simple command-line application that demonstrates basic principles of Java programming, including object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and user interaction through the console.

## Features

- User interaction through the console
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- File handling for data persistence
- Simple structure for easy understanding and extension

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE or text editor (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode)
- Git for version control

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/turdalievargen32/Java_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Java_Project
   ```

3. **Open the project in your preferred IDE:**

   - If using IntelliJ IDEA, select `File > Open` and choose the `Java_Project` directory.
   - If using Eclipse, select `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace` and choose the `Java_Project` directory.

4. **Compile the project:**

   Most IDEs will automatically compile the project. If you are using the command line, navigate to the `src` directory and compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac -d ../bin *.java
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command in your IDE or terminal:

```bash
java -cp bin Main
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
